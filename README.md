## Key Techniques

### 1. **Manual Templates and Verbalizers**
- Structures input data using human-readable templates for task-specific formatting.
- Maps model predictions to predefined label words for classification tasks.

### 2. **Prefix Tuning**
- Optimizes virtual tokens appended to the input sequence, guiding the model without modifying its parameters.
- Efficient for fine-tuning large pre-trained models like T5 and GPT-2.

### 3. **P-Tuning**
- Leverages continuous prompts to improve performance on tasks like sentiment classification.
- Demonstrates the flexibility of soft prompts with minimal parameter tuning.

### 4. **Few-Shot and Zero-Shot Learning**
- Evaluates models with minimal labeled data (few-shot) or without additional training (zero-shot).
- Highlights the adaptability of pre-trained models for diverse NLP tasks.

## Observations and Limitations

- **Few-Shot Learning**:
  - Boosts performance for structured tasks, particularly with consistent context or background in the training data.
- **Fine-Tuning Challenges**:
  - While fine-tuning improves task-specific accuracy, it may confuse some pre-trained models, reducing their baseline performance.
- **Binary Classification**:
  - Simplifies complex tasks (e.g., reading comprehension) but may lose nuanced understanding or ranking capabilities.
